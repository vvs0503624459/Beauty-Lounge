        article_text: `<div> <img class="first-image" src="images/CATS-EYE-MANICURE/cat-eye-771x-r.jpg" alt="cat-eye-manicure" /> <p><span>Cat’s eye</span> is a popular style of manicure, which is expressed in a

          spectacular look, masters use dark shades of varnishes. The coating can
          also be plain: for an interesting design, you can add decorative
          rhinestones, glitter or artistic painting.</p>

          The coating effect resembles the pattern of the famous mineral
          chrysoberyl, which is able to concentrate light in reflections or
          streaks. The technique is based on the interaction of varnish with a
          special magnetic tool. Metal particles in the coating formula rise from
          the total pigmented mass and as a result a unique characteristic pattern
          resembling a cat’s eye appears.
        </p>
        <p>
          This design method always looks relevant and attractive. It is actively
          used by masters to create a stylish, memorable nail design.

               <h3><span>Cat’s eye</span> manicure with design is one of the trendiest offers</h3>
        <p>
          The <span>cat’s eye</span> technique has not lost its popularity for decades, being
          in the top positions. The original composition of sequins on the nails
          looks very elegant and can be supplemented with various decorative
          elements:

          manicure is a minimalist accent on several nails. A massive design can
          spoil the appearance, so it is better not to use three-dimensional
          drawings, but beautiful nail art with patterns or stickers. An excellent
          choice is stamping from floristry and abstraction. A light base in
          tandem with dark and rich shades will look expensive and complete.

        article_text: `<div><img class="first-image" src="images/Hiden-coloring/1.jpg" alt="Hidden-coloring" />
        <p>
        Modern masters of hairdressing art are ready to offer many unusual
        transformation techniques. One of them is hidden coloring. This is a
        technique in which only the lower strands, sometimes the middle strands,
        are dyed in juicy, bright shades. The natural base allows you to avoid a
        radical transformation and experiment with new shades. The intriguing
        detail of the image is reliably covered by curls of natural color. But
        it is worth styling, gathering hair in a high tail or twisting curls,
        and bright strands will play in all their glory.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hidden hair coloring mainly uses such bright shades as crimson, green,
        lemon, red, blue, purple. By combining the palette, you can achieve an
        expressive and bold iridescent effect. Hidden lightening of the hair
        gives a highlight to the usual coloring. Dyeing strands in colors close
        to natural will create interesting highlights and enliven the image.
      </p>

      <h2>Hidden dyeing on dark hair - features of the technology</h2>
      <p>
        A dark shade requires preliminary care. Lightener should be applied to
        black and brown hair. It is not worth pursuing an ash blonde. It is
        enough to raise the shade by 2-3 tones. The tool is selected based on
        the appearance and condition of the strands. A dark base with pink,
        bright red, neon shades gives a spectacular game. You can choose one
        contrasting tone or several colors, creating a real rainbow. Making
        discreet hidden coloring on dark hair will allow muted shades of blue
        and green.
      </p>
      <img src="images/Hiden-coloring/2hidden-violet.jpg" alt="hidden purple coloring" />

      <h2>Concealed dyeing for blonde hair - a palette</h2>
      <p>
        It will not be difficult for blondes and owners of blond curls to carry
        out fashionable coloring. Choose a pigment and you can start working. On
        a light base, even rather restrained colors give an interesting play.
        Blonde curls effectively contrast with cold shades. Concealed dyeing of
        blonde hair does not require prior bleaching. But on blond strands, so
        that muted colors turn into an explosive accent, it is better to carry
        out lighting. Blondes do not need such preparation.
      </p>
      <img src="images/Hiden-coloring/3hidden-ginger.jpg" alt="coloring in light shades" />

      <p>
        Separately, it is worth saying about coloring on red hair. Preparation
        before the procedure is necessary here, as in the case of dyeing black
        hair. We go up by 2-3 tones on the warm palette. Bright basic looks
        great with close shades - red, orange. But you can also play on the
        contrast by making a hidden hair color in emerald, turquoise, purple or
        pink neon.
      </p>

      <h2>Hidden coloring on short hair - features</h2>
      <p>
        Hidden coloring on short hair has nuances. You will not be able to get
        hidden strands in the classical sense here. In the case of a pixie,
        colorists suggest making colorful patterns on the roots. For a high
        square, it is possible to work on several central divisions. If the edge
        of the strands falls to the middle of the neck, we can talk about
        traditional secret layers.
      </p>
      <img src="images/Hiden-coloring/4hidden-blue.png" alt="hidden coloring blue color" />

      <h2>Concealed coloring for long hair and curls of medium length</h2>
      <p>
        The possibilities of fashionistas with curls of medium length are much
        wider than those of their predecessors. Depending on the haircut, you
        can create both a basal dyeing and work on the entire length - from the
        roots to the tips. Take into account the volume of hair, the frequency
        of strands. It is worth collecting curls in a bundle or a tail. and a
        little secret flirts with juicy colors. An effective result is given by
        horizontal split-painting.
      </p>
      <img src="images/Hiden-coloring/5hidden-blond.jpg" alt="hidden dyeing for long hair" />

      <p>
        Concealed dyeing for long hair opens up access to all the possibilities
        of this coloring technique. The lower and middle layers of the occipital
        part of the head are involved in the work. You can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          dye colored strands near the roots, partially or along the entire
          length;
        </li>
        <li>create colored blocks;</li>
        <li>paint layers at the middle level;</li>
        <li>create stretches of color towards the center.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Even a light half beam will reveal intriguing transitions to the gaze of
        others.
      </p>

        especially those with brown eyes. The image will become even more delicate
        if you make your eyebrows a couple of tones lighter than your hair color.

      With the onset of cold weather, it is necessary to pay due attention to
      your own makeup, which will have several important differences from the
      one we use in the warm season. In winter, an even skin color is rare, and
      the epidermis is much more prone to peeling and irritation. The skin may
      become excessively pale or, on the contrary, be covered with red spots,
      which is caused by the influence of cold. For this reason, it is difficult
      to call winter makeup simple, but useful tips will help to do it
      correctly.
    </p>

    <h2>Winter makeup - features and recommendations</h2>

    <p>
      Winter makeup starts with the basics. First of all, you need to ensure
      proper hydration for the skin. A tonic or lotion that contains alcohol
      will not work for this. It is best to stop at cosmetic milk or cream. Do
      not forget to use masks, including formulations with olive oil, which
      perfectly nourish the skin, giving it freshness and additional radiance.
      Do not forget about contrast washing, which allows you to keep the skin in
      tone. Before going to bed, be sure to repeat the contrasting wash, after
      which you need to apply an oil or face cream that corresponds to the
      season.
    </p>

    <p>
      In order for the makeup to be done correctly, you will need a suitable
      tonal base. You can't do without tonal products in winter, even when the
      weather welcomes warmer days. Choose a cream with a tonal effect very
      carefully. The texture of the cosmetics should have a moderate thickness,
      and also contain a sunscreen filter with vitamins and antioxidants. This
      will protect the skin from frost. It is best to use a lighter tone in
      winter and abandon powder, as additional drying at this time of the year
      will have a negative effect.
    </p>

    <h2>Suitable lipstick for winter make-up</h2>

    <p>
      Makeup in the cold season involves the use of lipstick, which is
      characterized by a thicker texture. Its composition must necessarily
      include filters that protect against the effects of the sun. It is also
      worth using a moisturizing balm and weekly exfoliating procedures using
      the appropriate scrub. Daily care involves the use of a hygienic lipstick
      that protects the delicate skin of the lips from weathering.
    </p>

    <p>
      When choosing mascara, it is better to choose waterproof products. Their
      advantage is that in the event of tears caused by the wind or snow on the
      eyelashes, the mascara will remain in its former state, leaving no
      separation on the face. In winter, you should not use dark eyeliner, as it
      will make the paleness of the skin even more pronounced.
    </p>

    <h2>Makeup in winter has several bright trends that should be followed:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>creation of expressive arrows;</li>
      <li>experiments with bright shadows and grunge smokey-eyes;</li>
      <li>application of voluminous mascara and false eyelashes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Buying blush also involves a careful study of the funds presented on the
      market. Blush should be applied on the cheekbones, and the shade of the
      chosen product should be pink or peach. This technique will hide pale skin
      and create an attractive blush.
    </p>

    <p>
      Correctly applied cosmetics are the key to creating a bright image. First
      of all, you need to use a nourishing cream, which should be used before
      the foundation. It is necessary to make sure that the lips will receive
      the necessary moisture. After makeup, you should use a lipstick that
      contains nourishing or moisturizing agents. It should also include vitamin
      E and natural oils. When using matte lipstick, you should combine it with
      lip gloss.
    </p>

    <h2>Basic rules for removing make-up in winter</h2>

    <p>
      You need to remove makeup correctly in winter, because the freshness and
      youthful appearance of your skin will depend on it. Try to give preference
      to soft cosmetics that do not contain alcohol. When the makeup is removed,
      be sure to use a tonic for the face, as well as a soft gel for washing.
      The water should be warm, not hot. After removing makeup, you should use a
      cream or serum. The skin around the eyes is very delicate, so special
      cosmetics should be used to care for it. Before going to bed, don't forget
      to apply a balm on your lips, which will provide them with additional
      moisture.

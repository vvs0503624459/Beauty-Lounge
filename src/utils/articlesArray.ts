        `<div> <img src="images/CATS-EYE-MANICURE/cat-eye-771x-r.jpg" alt="cat-eye-manicure" /> <p><span>Cat’s eye</span> is a popular style of manicure, which is expressed in a
          spectacular, unique design. The attractive shine, as well as the depth
          of color, look expensive, without the need for additional decoration.
          Manicure is suitable for any length and shape of nails. For a more
          spectacular look, masters use dark shades of varnishes. The coating can
          also be plain: for an interesting design, you can add decorative
          rhinestones, glitter or artistic painting.</p>        
                   <p>The technique was developed by the Japanese company <span>Magnetic Nail
          Design</span>, which produces innovative beauty products of high quality.
        </p>
        <h3><span>Cat’s eye</span> manicure is always an expressive design</h3>
        <p>
          The coating effect resembles the pattern of the famous mineral
          chrysoberyl, which is able to concentrate light in reflections or
          streaks. The technique is based on the interaction of varnish with a
          special magnetic tool. Metal particles in the coating formula rise from
          the total pigmented mass and as a result a unique characteristic pattern
          resembling a cat’s eye appears.
        </p>
        <p>
          This design method always looks relevant and attractive. It is actively
          used by masters to create a stylish, memorable nail design.
        </p>
        <p>

        <h3><span>Cat’s eye</span> manicure with design is one of the trendiest offers</h3>
        <p>
          The <span>cat’s eye</span> technique has not lost its popularity for decades, being
          in the top positions. The original composition of sequins on the nails
          looks very elegant and can be supplemented with various decorative
          elements:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>stamping, stickers;</li>
          <li>with a drawing painted with monograms;</li>
          <li>a combination of other techniques, colors;</li>
          <li>foil, rhinestones;</li>
          <li>glitter, stones, shimmer.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Classic monochrome manicure impresses with its elegant design. If the
          velvet design seems less interesting, you should try a combination of
          matte coating and glossy finish. Another trendy solution for a cat’s eye
          manicure is a minimalist accent on several nails. A massive design can
          spoil the appearance, so it is better not to use three-dimensional
          drawings, but beautiful nail art with patterns or stickers. An excellent
          choice is stamping from floristry and abstraction. A light base in
          tandem with dark and rich shades will look expensive and complete.

          shades will look exquisite. Iridescence, the shine of multi-colored
          sequins, a gentle glow on a dark background will emphasize the fabulous
          appearance of the gradient. You can complement the 3D design with small
          rhinestones or acrylic powder. Even a plain version with a minimal
          amount of decor will look great and draw attention to your manicure.
